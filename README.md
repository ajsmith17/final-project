### User Stories

User will open the main page that has top US headlines and a nav bar with various categories (sports, business, entertainment, etc.) that will open pages with category specific headlines.

The top headline will automatically be featured, however the user can click on any one of the listed headlines on the right and view the title, image, and description of that article. There is a link to each article below the information.

### Stretch Goals

Implement a headline ticker on the main page (I'm thinking carousel of headlines, but would love to have a continuous flow like you would see on ESPN or Fox News). Search page with various request parameters to get more specific articles.
