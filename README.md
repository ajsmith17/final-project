# final-project (News App)

### User Stories

User will open the main page that has top headlines and a nav bar with various categories (sports, business, entertainment, etc.) that will open pages with category specific headlines.

Each article will have a comment section where you can add a temporary username and your comment (no authentication, not my strong suit and real news sites rarely have them anyway).

### Stretch Goals

Implement a headline ticker on the main page (I'm thinking carousel of headlines, but would love to have a continuous flow like you would see on ESPN or Fox News)
